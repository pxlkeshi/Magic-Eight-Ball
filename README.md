# Magic Eight Ball 🎱

This is a fun JavaScript project that simulates a Magic Eight Ball. Ask it a question, and it will give you a random response—just like the classic toy!

## 🔍 How It Works
- The user enters a name (optional) and a question
- The program generates a random number between 0 and 7
- Based on that number, it selects one of eight possible responses
- The response is displayed in the console

## 💡 Sample Output
Hello, Jane! Jane has asked: Will I get an A on my project? It is decidedly so
